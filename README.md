# Apple Music for Windows

Electron-powered Apple Music app for Windows, made in 6 hours.  
I know, it's Electron. But hey, at least it's not iTunes - let's think this way.

_UI will be in your Apple ID language, mine is Polish._

## Featuring

- Slightly windowsified UI inspired by UWP (e.g. acrylic sidebar)
- Widevine CDM for all your Apple Music DRM protected tracks
- Frameless design with custom CSS and some minor QoL changes
- Still a bit choppy interface, but works better than iTunes in most cases

## What doesn't work

- Dolby Atmos playback, because it's not supported on the web version of Apple Music
- Other more advanced features like streaming to an AirPlay device
