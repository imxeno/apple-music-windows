Electron-powered Apple Music app for Windows, made in 6 hours.  
I know, it's Electron. But hey, at least it's not iTunes - let's think this way.

_UI will be in your Apple ID language, mine is Polish._

## Featuring

- Slightly windowsified UI inspired by UWP (e.g. acrylic sidebar)
- Widevine CDM for all your Apple Music DRM protected tracks
- Frameless design with custom CSS and some minor QoL changes
- Windows dark theme support
- Still a bit choppy interface, but works better than iTunes in most cases

## What doesn't work

- Dolby Atmos playback, because it's not supported on the web version of Apple Music
- Other more advanced features like streaming to an AirPlay device

## Known issues

- While the dark mode works, switching between Windows themes when the app is open causes a visual glitch connected with the acrylic sidebar - a fix for this should be fairy simple, but I didn't have enough motivation to do that ðŸ˜›
- From time to time you may encounter an error presented in a form of Apple-style alert - in that case it's probably Apple's fault - before submitting a bug report please check if you can reproduce it using the official Apple Music web app
